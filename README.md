## ü§µ Who I am 

Hi, my name is Jackson Arango. 
I'm live in Medell√≠n, Colombia.

## ‚öô What I'm doing 

I'm interested in Java, and right now I'm learning Spring Boot, how to consume API's, and Ajax.

I plan to apply it in [E-commerce](https://github.com/JacksonSan009/E-commerce)

## ‚è± What I'm want to do 
* Learn and make some project with AWS and Angular.

* A game. I don't know yet what I'm wanna do, but I'm have something in mind. 

* Something with I.A. Maybe a bot who can complete a game by his own or a boy chat.

* I want to make some kind of bot for Twitch where the bot shows a meme 
with the vocal recognition, so you just have to say the name of the meme
and the bot would show it to the viewers.

* Google Calendar Template extension. The idea is create a extension that to create events as templates, 
that allow me to put the same event every time I need it, so that allow to make at routene, and also allow to add it automaticly for month.
